# HTTP Server

The server opens a socket and listens for requests sent by the client. If the request is successfully received and contains a 
well-formed HTTP request, the server will return an HTTP response with a status of 200 OK. The server also includes a response_error function to return a response with a status of 500 Internal Server Error.

Close the server with the keyboard command Ctrl-C.
